This event, developed by the WIE ESSTHS affinity group, brought together many people around a significant cause. We invited specialized doctors who generously distributed brochures filled with crucial information on the subject. Their goal was clear: to raise awareness and educate as many people as possible about this disease that affects so many lives.But it didnt stop there. For those who wanted to take it a step further, screening sessions were organized throughout the day. We were impressed by the number of students who showed interest and took the time to participate in these screenings. This demonstrated just how committed the community is and how ready they are to take action for prevention and early detection.It was a day of great importance for us and for all the participants. It strengthened our understanding and awareness of breast cancer while fostering a sense of solidarity and mutual support. Looking around, we felt deep gratitude towards everyone who contributed to the success of this event, and we realized the positive impact that initiatives like this can have on our community.',
